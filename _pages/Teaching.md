I was a teaching assistant for Experimental Physics during my first year of master's study. Since I have gone through the same course, I could address the questions and problems raised by students and prepared proper materials for final projects. In particular, one group of students carried out the experiment that was originally my final project when I took the course. With my suggestions, they were able to improve the setup and, further, write a VPython program to show an animation of the whole device. They presented their works at the Taiwan Physics Society annual meeting 2018 as a poster presentation.

I was also involved in outreach activities to engage high school students in high energy physics. I worked as a teaching assistant for Professor Gunther M. Roland from MIT in his Machine Learning in High Energy Physics course hosted in Taipei, Taiwan. Having abundant experiences in using HEP analyses, I provided students instructions to learn ROOT and TMVA and helped them connect the physics concepts to the programming language. Attending this 7-day and highly intensive school was a valuable experience for me. It was my privilege to instruct those talented students and work with Professor Gunther.

As a research assistant for Professor Chia-Ming Kuo, we organized several One-day High Energy Physics (HEP) schools, the first HEP-related popular science education activity in Taiwan. The initiative of this school is to engage the high school students in particle physics. We designed the structure and material of the school that emphasizes the core competencies such as creativity, independent thinking, and ability in practical problem solving. I translated and modified manuals from S'Cool LAB at CERN and from masterclasses hold by the Quarknet organization. I also made lecture notes and slides and served as the lecturer in the school.  I was capable of explaining advanced knowledge and techniques in a way that high school students understood. Despite exhausting when organizing and preparing the materials for the school, it paid back when I read the honest and warm feedbacks from students on how they were inspired and encouraged by us.
