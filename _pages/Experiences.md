## Physics Analyses
I joined the experimental high energy physics group at National Central University (NCU, Taiwan) to work on my undergraduate project and later my master thesis under the supervision of Professor Chia-Ming Kuo. I performed a **search for rare decays of the Higgs and Z bosons into J/&psi; meson and a photon, where the J/&psi; meson subsequently decays into a muon pair**, using data collected by the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector at Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The Higgs boson decay channel is one of the most promising probes to the Higgs-Charm coupling in the LHC environment. On the other hand, the decay process $$Z\to J/\psi+\gamma$$ was the first search that related the standard model Z boson to a quarkonium state in CMS. I served as the contact person for the analysis and have successfully addressed all the concerns and recommendations brought up by the Physics Analysis Group conveners, review committee, collaborators, physics coordinators, and journal referees. The search was published in the European Physics Journal C, Eur. Phys. J. C 79 (2019) 94. I also participated in the analysis of a Higgs boson decays into two photons, one of which has an internal conversion into a muon pair. This decay channel is also named as Higgs Dalitz decay. I mainly worked on measuring the trigger efficiency and building up the background estimation method. The results were published in the Journal of High Energy Physics, JHEP 11 (2018) 152.

I am currently working on developing proper simulations of background processes for this search, an important yet missing piece of the current analysis chain. Since the relevant background processes have large cross-sections due to the low di-muon invariant mass, efficient and realistic production of simulated events is a challenge. I implemented generator filters to select events that are similar in both the signal topology and the phase space and was able to bring a significant reduction of cross-sections, making the production of background simulations feasible. This work opens up several possibilities for improvement in the search, such as an advanced event selection optimization or categorization in the analysis with machine learning techniques, foreseeably leading to a better search sensitivity and an eventual observation of this decay channel in the future run of LHC.

## Service Work
In addition to physics analyses, I worked on the measurement of electron veto efficiency for the 2017 and 2018 data-taking periods under the Electron-Photon Physics Object Group (E-Gamma POG). I improved and refined the evaluation of systematic uncertainties and laid the groundwork for the measurement. The conveners highly appreciated my presentations, works, and contributions to the group.

## Beam-tests
I participated in the beam-tests for the CMS High Granularity Calorimeter (HGCal) project for High Luminosity LHC hold at CERN since the summer of 2016 [[1]](#ref). After I passed the oral defense at the beginning of my second year of master's study, I went to CERN and stayed there for three months to attend the last beam-test for the following two years. I applied the machine learning techniques in electron energy reconstruction and electron-pion identification with collaborators from the University of Minnesota. With Machine Learning, better energy resolutions for electrons with higher energy were achieved as compared to those attained with traditional reconstruction methods. I trained a classifier using simulation to discriminate electron-like pion events with training features that are the same as those used in the regression. A preliminary result showed that the classifier rejected more than 99.5% of pions while retaining 99% of the electrons. A summary of my study can be found in the <a href="https://hrjheng.github.io/pdfs/Thesis-Final-HaoRen.pdf" target="_blank">appendix C in my thesis of master degree</a>. Photo below [[2]](#ref) shows me holding the prototype HGCAL detector planes, based on 6" silicon modules, at CERN in October 2018.

## Teaching & Outreach
I was a teaching assistant for Experimental Physics during my first year of master's study. Since I have gone through the same course, I could address the questions and problems raised by students and prepared proper materials for final projects. In particular, one group of students carried out the experiment that was originally my final project when I took the course. With my suggestions, they were able to improve the setup and, further, write a VPython program to show an animation of the whole device. They presented their works at the Taiwan Physics Society annual meeting 2018 as a poster presentation.

I was also involved in outreach activities to engage high school students in high energy physics. I worked as a teaching assistant for Professor Gunther M. Roland from MIT in his Machine Learning in High Energy Physics course hosted in Taipei, Taiwan. Having abundant experiences in using HEP analyses, I provided students instructions to learn ROOT and TMVA and helped them connect the physics concepts to the programming language. Attending this 7-day and highly intensive school was a valuable experience for me. It was my privilege to instruct those talented students and work with Professor Gunther.

As a research assistant for Professor Chia-Ming Kuo, we organized several One-day High Energy Physics (HEP) schools, the first HEP-related popular science education activity in Taiwan. The initiative of this school is to engage the high school students in particle physics. We designed the structure and material of the school that emphasizes the core competencies such as creativity, independent thinking, and ability in practical problem solving. I translated and modified manuals from S'Cool LAB at CERN and from masterclasses hold by the Quarknet organization. I also made lecture notes and slides and served as the lecturer in the school.  I was capable of explaining advanced knowledge and techniques in a way that high school students understood. Despite exhausting when organizing and preparing the materials for the school, it paid back when I read the honest and warm feedbacks from students on how they were inspired and encouraged by us.
