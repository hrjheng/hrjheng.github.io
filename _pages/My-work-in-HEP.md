I started working on high-energy experimental physics when I was in my junior year in college. My main analysis is to search for the rare decays of Z and Higgs bosons to J/&psi; meson plus photon at $$\sqrt{s}$$ = 13 TeV in CMS (Compact Muon Solenoid) Collaboration [1]. This rare decay of the Z boson is the first search in the CMS. 
I also help on measuring the trigger efficiency and building up the background estimation method in the Higgs Dalitz decay ($$H\rightarrow\gamma^{*}\gamma\rightarrow\mu\mu\gamma$$) [2], as it shares the common strategy.
Apart from these two, I attended HGCAL (High Granularity Calorimeter) beam test when I went to CERN in the summer. The only thing I could contribute is to take the shifts and follow the instructions to take data. Before I graduate from my master degree, I will go to CERN again and stay there for around 3 months to participate the last beam test in the following two years. Hopefully I can learn more about the hardware and have deeper understanding of how the detectors work.
