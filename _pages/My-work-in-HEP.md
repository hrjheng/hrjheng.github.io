I joined the HEP group in National Central University (NCU) to work on my undergraduate project when I was junior. My main analysis is to search for the rare decays of the Z and Higgs bosons to J/&psi; meson and a photon at $$\sqrt{s}$$ = 13 TeV in CMS (Compact Muon Solenoid) Collaboration [1]. [INTRODUCE THIS ANALYSIS] The process $$Z\to J/\psi+\gamma$$ is the first search on this decay in CMS. In my first year of master degree, I had the opportunity to be the contact of this analysis. Giving the pre-approval talk, going through ARC (analysis review committee) review, getting approved by convenors, and addressing all the comments from CWR (collaboration wide review) and final reading, these are the most challenging tasks I've ever carried out.
I also help on measuring the trigger efficiency and building up the background estimation method in the Higgs Dalitz decay ($$H\rightarrow\gamma^{*}\gamma\rightarrow\mu\mu\gamma$$) [2], as both of them share the same strategy as in my analysis.
[RE-WRITE THIS PARAGRAPH] Apart from these two, I attended HGCAL (High Granularity Calorimeter) beam test when I went to CERN in the summer [3]. The only thing I could contribute is to take the shifts and follow the instructions to take data. The 2016 HGCAL beamtest paper was published in JINST [4], which is also the first paper on this CMS upgrade project. Before I graduate from my master degree, I will go to CERN again and stay there for around 3 months to participate in the last beam test in the following two years. Hopefully I can learn more about the hardware and have deeper understanding of how the detectors work. Other than the HGCAL work, I involve in the measurement of the electron veto scale factors, belonging to e-gamma physics object group (EGM-POG), in 2017 and 2018 data.
