I joined the experimental HEP group in National Central University (NCU, Taiwan) to work on my undergraduate project and later my master thesis with Professor Chia-Ming Kuo as my supervisor. My main analysis was **search for rare decays of Z and Higgs bosons to J/&psi; and a photon in proton-proton collisions at $$\sqrt{s}$$ = 13 TeV** in Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) Collaboration. The decay process $$Z\to J/\psi+\gamma$$ was the first search that related the standard model Z boson to the quarkonium stste in CMS. In the first year of my master degree, I had the opportunity to serve the contact person of the analysis. I've successfully went through the internal review process in CMS Collaboration, including giving the pre-approval talk, going through the analysis review committee's review, giving approval talk and getting approved by convenors, addressing comments from collaboration wide review and final reading. The final results were published at The European Physical Journal C [1]. I also helped on measuring the trigger efficiency and building up the background estimation method in the Higgs Dalitz decay($$H\rightarrow\gamma\*\gamma\rightarrow\mu\mu\gamma$$) [2].

 Apart from these two, I attended HGCAL (High Granularity Calorimeter) beam test when I went to CERN in the summer [3]. The only thing I could contribute is to take the shifts and follow the instructions to take data. The 2016 HGCAL beamtest paper was published in JINST [4], which is also the first paper on this CMS upgrade project. Before I graduate from my master degree, I will go to CERN again and stay there for around 3 months to participate in the last beam test in the following two years. Hopefully I can learn more about the hardware and have deeper understanding of how the detectors work. Other than the HGCAL work, I involve in the measurement of the electron veto scale factors, belonging to e-gamma physics object group (EGM-POG), in 2017 and 2018 data.
