<!-- I am a research assistant at the Center of High-energy and High-field Physics at National Central University, Taiwan. My current work includes two tasks. One is to produce proper background simulations for the Higgs Dalitz decay search in Compact Muon Solenoid collaboration, and the other one is to organize One-day High Energy Physics schools for Taiwanese high school students. At the same time, I am applying for the Ph.D. program in the fall 2021. -->
I am a first-year graduate student in the physics department at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. My research interests are experimental nuclear and particle physics, and I will be working on projects in the sPHENIX experiment at Brookhaven National Laboratory and CMS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider at European Organization for Nuclear Research.
